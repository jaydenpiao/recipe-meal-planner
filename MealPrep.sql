Optional toppings: lettuce, tomato slices, onion slices, pickles, cheese slices, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise
Instructions:

Preheat your grill or a skillet over medium-high heat.

Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and form each into a patty about 3/4-inch thick. Make a small indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.

Season both sides of each patty with salt and pepper.

Place the patties on the grill or in the skillet and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or longer if you prefer your burgers more well-done.

 place a slice of cheese on each patty during the last minute of cooking to allow it to melt.

(4, 'Fries', 
'Ingredients:

4 large potatoes (Russet or Yukon Gold work well)

Instructions:

Peel the potatoes and cut them into long, thin strips about 1/4-inch thick. Try to keep the size and thickness of the fries as uniform as possible for even cooking.

Rinse the cut potatoes in cold water to remove excess starch, then pat them dry with paper towels.

Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot or deep fryer with about 2-3 inches of vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 325°F (163°C) using a deep-fry thermometer to check the temperature.

Carefully add the fries to the hot oil in small batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Fry for about 3-4 minutes, or until they are soft but not browned. This is called "blanching" and helps to cook the potatoes without browning them.

Remove the fries from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain them on a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet. Let them cool for a few minutes.

Increase the temperature of the oil to 375°F (190°C).

Return the fries to the hot oil in batches and fry again for 3-4 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy.

Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Once hot, place the sandwich in the skillet.

Grill the sandwich for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted. Press down lightly with a spatula for even grilling, but be careful not to flatten the sandwich too much.

1 cup quinoa
2 cups water or vegetable broth
